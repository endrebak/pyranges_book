# Subsetting PyRanges

There are many ways to subset a PyRanges object. Each returns a new PyRanges object and does not change the old one.

For data exploration, the functions head, tail and sample (random choice without
replacment) are convenient. They take an argument n to denote how many entries
you want.

```{python}

import pyranges as pr

gr = pr.data.chipseq()
print(gr.sample())
print(gr.tail(4))
```

By subsetting with a list you can select one or more columns:

```{python}

import pyranges as pr

gr = pr.data.chipseq()
print(gr)
print(gr[["Name"]])
```

By subsetting using a boolean vector, you can get specific rows:

```{python}

import pyranges as pr

cpg = pr.data.cpg()
print(cpg[cpg.CpG > 50])
```


By using strings, tuples and slices, you can subset the PyRanges based on position:

Chromosome only


```{python tidy=FALSE}

print(gr["chrX"])
```

Chromosome and Strand


```{python tidy=FALSE}

print(gr["chrX", "-"])
```

Chromosome and Slice


```{python tidy=FALSE}

print(gr["chrX", 150000000:160000000])
```

Chromosome, Strand and Slice


```{python tidy=FALSE}

print(gr["chrX", "-", 150000000:160000000])
```

Slice

Only using slices returns all ranges from all chromosomes and strands within those coordinates.

```{python tidy=FALSE}

print(gr[0:100000])
```

Note that while the slice-operator is fast and returns seemingly immediately, it
is inefficient; it builds the interval overlap datastructure anew every query.
So if you have multiple queries you should build another PyRanges and do an
intersect-operation.

Strand


```{python tidy=FALSE}

print(gr["+"])
```

Slice and Strand


```{python tidy=FALSE}

print(gr["+", 0:100000])
```
